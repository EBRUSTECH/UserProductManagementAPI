A user/product API management system using layer architecture

To set - up the project is simple:
Clone the project or if you have the zip file then unzip it and add an appsettings.Json file to the API layer, set up your connection string and email connection string
Update the database and run the project to test the endpoints.
Due to time, I will make future changes to areas not working yet.
